  abstract  = {Increasingly we rely on machine intelligence for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. This tutorial reviews the prevalent methods for model-based autonomous decision making based on observations and prior knowledge, primarily in the context of classification. Both observations and the knowledge-base available for reasoning are treated as being uncertain. Accordingly, the central themes of this tutorial are quantitative modeling of uncertainty, the rules required to combine such uncertain information, and the task of decision making under uncertainty. The paper covers the main approaches to uncertain knowledge representation and reasoning, in particular, Bayesian probability theory, possibility theory, reasoning based on belief functions and finally imprecise probability theory. The main feature of the tutorial is that it illustrates various approaches with several testing scenarios, and provides MATLAB solutions for them as a supplementary material for an interested reader.},

To address this fundamental gap, we investigated the dynamics of Leidenfrost droplets restricted by metal disks. The disk alters the accumulation and release of the vapour generated by the droplet, and substantially changes its dynamic characteristics. Our experiments reveal the formation of oscillating multi-lobed structures when restricting the droplet within a disk. In comparison, patterning offset radial grooves on the surface of the disk rectifies the vapour flow and facilitates the self-propulsion of the droplet along the edge of the disk. Our work offers opportunities for developing soft and short-living actuators, which can operate at high temperatures.},

The main idea is to modify an accurate and fast elastic registration algorithm (Local All-Pass - LAP) so that it returns a parametric displacement field, and to estimate the intensity changes by fitting another parametric expression. Although we demonstrate the methodology using a low-order parametric model, our approach is highly flexible and easily allows substantially richer parametrisations, while requiring only limited extra computation cost. In addition, we propose two novel quantitative criteria to evaluate the accuracy of the alignment of two images ('salience correlation') and the number of degrees of freedom ('parsimony') of a displacement field, respectively. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the high accuracy and computational efficiency of our methodology. Furthermore,  we demonstrate that the resulting displacement fields are more parsimonious than the ones obtained in other state-of-the-art image registration approaches.},

To compare these differing networks, we propose a new possibilistic counterpart to the uncertain implication rule that exists in evidential networks. Using the Captain's decision problem, we analyse the performance of these networks when estimating the number of days a ship will be delayed based on a mixture of uncertain knowledge. We demonstrate that the evidential network is more cautious to changes in uncertainty whereas the possibilistic network is more sensitive. This characteristic could allow the possibilistic network to be used to perform sensitivity analysis on a system.},

In this paper we present a method for TVD estimation which is suitable for real-time non-stationary applications. The proposed method combines local all-pass (LAP) filters with a Kalman filter.

Such disturbed flow patterns activate pro-inflammatory phenotypes in endothelial cells, damaging the endothelial layer and can lead to atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Here, we report a microfluidic system with integrated ridge-shaped obstacles for generating controllable disturbed flow patterns. This system is used to study the effect of disturbed flow on the cytoskeleton remodeling and nuclear shape and size of cultured human aortic endothelial cells. Our results demonstrate that the generated disturbed flow changes the orientation angle of actin stress fibers and reduces the nuclear size while increases the nuclear circularity.},

To complicate the issue, the AUV needs to localize the vessel using angle-only measurements. Accordingly, we propose a random sampling based trajectory planning algorithm that incorporates both a dynamic goal and the need to localize that goal. More precisely, we incorporate an information theoretic cost into a rapid-exploring random tree trajectory planning framework thus allowing the AUV to both localize and reach the recovery vessel.

Specifically, we are interested in planning the trajectory of an AUV as it returns to a moving recovery vessel. To aid in this task, the AUV is equipped with a passive, angle-only, sensor to enable localization of the recovery vessel. Accordingly, we present an algorithm that is capable of dynamically updating the trajectory of the AUV given measurement data from the passive sensor. Our approach is based on adapting a static trajectory planning algorithm from robotics, known as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*), to allow for localization and tracking of a dynamic target (i.e. the recovery vessel). In contrast to dynamic programming or fixed grid trajectory planning, the RRT* offers a computationally efficient method for long-term trajectory planning with probabilistic guarantees of optimality. In this framework, we explore two options: trajectory planning based on minimising the distance to the target; and trajectory planning based on maximising the tracking accuracy of the target using an information theoretic cost. Using AUV recovery as an evaluation scenario, we analyse and evaluate the proposed trajectory planning algorithm against traditional dynamic programming methods. In particular, we consider trajectory planning in noisy and obstructed environments.},

The fitting step can be performed very efficiently by solving a linear system of equations. In terms of the fitting model, it is easy to change the type of models to do the parametric fitting for specific applications.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework that relies upon the brightness consistency hypothesis-a pixel's intensity is maintained throughout the transformation. Instead of assuming small distortion and linearizing the problem (e.g. via Taylor Series expansion), we propose to interpret the brightness hypothesis as an all-pass filtering relation between the two images. The key advantages of this new interpretation are that no restrictions are placed on the amplitude of the deformation or on the spatial variations of the images. Moreover, by converting the all-pass filtering to a linear forward-backward filtering relation, our solution to the estimation problem equates to solving a linear system of equations, which leads to a highly efficient implementation. Using this framework, we develop a fast algorithm that relates one image to another, on a local level, using an all-pass filter and then extracts the deformation from the filter-hence the name 'Local All-Pass' (LAP) algorithm. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real deformations that are found in applications, such as image registration and motion estimation. In particular, when compared with a selection of image registration algorithms, the LAP obtains very accurate results for significantly reduced computation time and is very robust to noise corruption.},

Importantly, our cost functions combine both positional and velocity covariance information to allow the scheduler to choose the optimum source-waveform action. Using realistic multistatic sonobuoy simulations, we demonstrate that each cost function results in a different choice of source-waveform actions, which in turn affects the performance of the scheduler.

In particular, recent developments in high density sEMG (HD-sEMG), which allow simultaneous recordings from a greater number of electrodes, enable the calculation of muscle attributes such as the conduction velocity of motor unit action potentials. However, as with  standard recording montages, HD-sEMG requires careful placement of the electrodes to align with the direction of the muscle fibres, thus limiting practical applications. In this paper we demonstrate an algorithm for calculating muscle fibre conduction velocity which is independent of the alignment of the array. The algorithm automatically corrects for the misalignment of the array whilst estimating the conduction velocity using common local all-pass (CLAP) filters. Specifically, the misalignment is modelled as a rotation of the array relative to the fibre and this rotation is estimated by iteratively fitting the model to the output of the CLAP filters. We validate the proposed algorithm on simulated HD-sEMG data generated from a realistic biological model, demonstrating that the algorithm obtains an accurate estimate of the conduction velocity even when the array is misaligned.},

A joint Compressed Sensing reconstruction and motion estimation of the subsampled data provides motion-resolved MR images (respiratory + cardiac). A 1-POINT DIXON method is applied to these MR images to derive a motion-resolved attenuation map. The motion model and the attenuation map are fed to the Customizable and Advanced Software for Tomographic Reconstruction (CASToR) PET reconstruction system in which the motion correction is incorporated. All reconstruction steps are performed online on the scanner via Gadgetron to provide a clinically feasible setup for improved general applicability. The method was evaluated on 36 patients with suspected liver or lung metastasis in terms of lesion quantification (SUVmax, SNR, contrast), delineation (FWHM, slope steepness) and diagnostic confidence level (3-point Likert-scale).

Results: A motion correction could be conducted for all patients, however, only in 30 patients moving lesions could be observed. For the examined 134 malignant lesions, an average improvement in lesion quantification of 22%, delineation of 64% and diagnostic confidence level of 23% was achieved.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a clinically feasible setup for respiratory and cardiac motion correction of PET data by simultaneous short-term MRI. The acquisition sequence and all reconstruction steps are publicly available to foster multi-center studies and various motion correction scenarios.},

  abstract  = {We propose an efficient method for image registration based on iteratively fitting a parametric model to the output of an elastic registration. It combines the flexibility of elastic registration - able to estimate complex deformations - with the robustness of parametric registration - able to estimate very large displacement. Our approach is made feasible by using the recent Local All-Pass (LAP) algorithm; a fast and accurate filter-based method for estimating the local deformation between two images. Moreover, at each iteration we fit a linear parametric model to the local deformation which is equivalent to solving a linear system of equations (very fast and efficient). We use a quadratic polynomial model however the framework can easily be extended to more complicated models. The significant advantage of the proposed method is its robustness to model mis-match (e.g. noise and blurring). Experimental results on synthetic images and real images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly accurate and outperforms a selection of image registration approaches.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the minimum rate of innovation (RI) in a noisy setting. First, we adapt a recent model-fitting algorithm for FRI recovery and demonstrate that it achieves the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. Using this algorithm, we then present a framework to estimate the minimum RI based on fitting the sparsest model to the noisy samples whilst satisfying a mean squared error (MSE) criterion - a signal is recovered if the output MSE is less than the input MSE. Specifically, given a RI, we use the MSE criterion to judge whether our model-fitting has been a success or a failure. Using this output, we present a Dichotomic algorithm that performs a binary search for the minimum RI and demonstrate that it obtains a sparser RI estimate than an existing information criterion approach.},

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to estimate motion in volumetric images based on the recently developed Local All-Pass (LAP) optical flow framework. The framework is built upon the idea that any motion can be regarded as a local rigid displacement and is hence equivalent to all-pass filtering. Accordingly, our algorithm aims to relate two images, on a local level, using a 3D all-pass filter and then extract the local motion flow from the filter. As this process is based on filtering, it can be efficiently repeated over the whole image volume allowing fast estimation of a dense 3D motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on both synthetic motion flows and in-vivo MRI data involving respiratory motion. In particular, the algorithm obtains greater accuracy for significantly reduced computation time when compared to competing approaches.},
