I am grateful to be part of the team receiving one of the best paper awards at ICAS 2021 for our work on ''*Improving Automated Search for Underwater Threats Using Multistatic Sensor Fields by Incorporating Unconfirmed Track Information*''. This work was a joint collaboration with colleagues at the University of Melbourne and the DSTG.

A video recording of the conference presentation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_jBNSH9zael4UnAbE1EL0M1HC6Wbk4Cm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> and the paper is available here: <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/ICAS2021.pdf'}}" target="_blank">Improving Automated Search for Underwater Threats Using Multistatic Sensor Fields by Incorporating Unconfirmed Track Information</a>.
