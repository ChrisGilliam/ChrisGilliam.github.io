I am pleased to announce that I have joined the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/eese/index.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Birmingham as an <a href="https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/chris-gilliam" target="_blank">Assistant Professor in Applied Signal Processing</a>.


I will be recruiting PhD students who are interested in signal/image processing for a variety of different applications. There may also be the opportunity for joint PhD projects with the University of Melbourne.
