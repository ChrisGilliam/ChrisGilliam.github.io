Congratulations to Thomas Küstner and the team for receiving the best paper award at APSIPA 2020 for our work on ''*Deep-learning based motion-corrected image reconstruction in 4D magnetic resonance imaging of the body trunk*''. This work was a multi-institute collaboration between the <a href="http://www.midaslab.org/" target="_blank">Medical Image And Data Analysis</a> (MIDAS) lab in University of Tübingen, King's College London, the University of Stuttgart, RMIT University, Imperial College London and the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The paper is available here: <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/APSIPA2020b.pdf'}}" target="_blank">Deep-learning based motion-corrected image reconstruction in 4D magnetic resonance imaging of the body trunk</a>.
