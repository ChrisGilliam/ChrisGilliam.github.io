We have just published a new paper in APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing on "*Self-Supervised Motion-Corrected Image Reconstruction Network for 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Body Trunk*". This paper is an extension of our <a href="https://chrisgilliam.github.io/news/2020_12_10/" target="_blank">award winning APSIPA 2020 conference paper</a>.

The paper presents a deep-learning based motion-corrected 4D (3D spatial + time) image reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach combines a non-rigid registration network and a 4D reconstruction network. The non-rigid registration network is based on our <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/TIP2017.pdf'}}" target="_blank">local all-pass filter framework for image registration</a> which was extended to MRI data <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/ISBI2016.pdf'}}" target="_blank">here</a>.

The paper is available here: <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/APSIPA_Trans2022.pdf'}}" target="_blank">Self-Supervised Motion-Corrected Image Reconstruction Network for 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Body Trunk</a>.
