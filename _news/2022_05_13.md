We have just presented our IEEE Signal Processing Letter on "*An Adaptive All-Pass Filter for Time-Varying Delay Estimation*" at ICASSP 2022. This work presents an adaptive filter for time-varying delay estimation based on an all-pass filtering framework. The coefficients of the adaptive filter evolve over time to provide an online estimate of the time-varying delay between two signals.

A video recording of the conference presentation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UOHej75apX2VYoFO3EePnPZn7ykQYTK-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> and the paper is available here: <a href="{{ entry.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/Adaptive_All_Pass_arXiv.pdf'}}" target="_blank">An Adaptive All-Pass Filter for Time-Varying Delay Estimation</a>. Finally code to implement the filter is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/beteje/LAP_DelayEstimation/tree/master/Adaptive_AllPass" target="_blank">Adaptive AllPass</a>.
