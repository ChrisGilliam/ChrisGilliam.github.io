We have just published two new papers in the area of quantum enhanced navigation. The first paper is in The Journal of Navigation on "*Improving measurement performance via fusion of classical and quantum accelerometers*". The second paper is in Navigation: Journal of the Institute of Navigation on "*Probabilistic Map Matching for Robust Inertial Navigation Aiding*". These works focus on the fusion of quantum accelerometers and gravimeters in traditional inertial navigation systems (INS). Specifically, the first paper proposes a method to fuse a quantum and traditional accelerometer to remove sensor drift whilst maintaining a high dynamic range and sampling rate. The second paper tackles the problem of aiding a vehicleâ€™s inertial navigation system in a GNSS-denied environment via gravity map matching.

These works are a multi-institute collaboration between the University of Birmingham, RMIT university, University of Melbourne and the <a href="https://physics.anu.edu.au/research/qst/atom_laser/" target="_blank">Atom Laser Group</a> at the Australian National University (ANU).
