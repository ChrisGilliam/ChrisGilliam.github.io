I am an Assistant Professor in Applied Signal Processing in the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/engineering/eese/index.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering</a> at the University of Birmingham, UK.

My research interests include: sampling theory, specifically the sampling of parametric non-bandlimited signals; applications of sampling theory to image processing, in particular Image-Based Rendering (IBR); Motion estimation and registration for image sequences, in particular biological and medical imaging; Radar imaging systems; and Sensor scheduling.
