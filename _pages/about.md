My research interests include: sampling theory, specifically the sampling of parametric non-bandlimited signals; applications of sampling theory to image processing, in particular Image-Based Rendering (IBR); Motion estimation and registration for image sequences, in particular biological and medical imaging; Radar imaging systems; and Sensor scheduling.
